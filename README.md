# xShell
This is a simple *NIX shell written in C. It was developed for an assignment for the graduate-level OS class at Drexel University.

It can possibly be loaded and run as a kernel module. However, this functionality is not implemented at present.

It implements several features present in widely used shell environments, plus some of my own ideas.
